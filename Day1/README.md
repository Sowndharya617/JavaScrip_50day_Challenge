# Stopwatch Project

Welcome to the **Stopwatch Project**! This is a simple stopwatch built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, reset, and record lap times. This project demonstrates basic web development concepts and can be a useful tool for timing events.

## Features

- **Start/Stop the timer**: Start or stop the stopwatch with a single button click.
- **Reset the timer**: Reset the stopwatch to zero, clearing the time and lap times.
- **Record lap times**: Capture lap times while the stopwatch is running and display them in a list.
- **Display format**: The time is displayed in a `MM:SS:MS` format (Minutes: Seconds: Milliseconds).

## Watch the Demo

You can watch the demo of how the stopwatch works in the following video:

## Features Walkthrough

1. **Start/Stop Button**: 
   - Clicking on the **Start** button starts the stopwatch. It will change to **Stop** once the timer begins. Clicking **Stop** will pause the timer.
   
2. **Reset Button**: 
   - The **Reset** button will reset the stopwatch back to `00:00.00` and clear any recorded lap times.
   
3. **Lap Button**: 
   - Clicking on the **Lap** button records the current time and adds it to the list below the stopwatch display. This allows you to track multiple times during a session.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Stopwatch**: Click on the **Start** button to start the timer.
2. **Stop the Stopwatch**: Click on the **Stop** button to pause the timer.
3. **Record Lap Times**: While the stopwatch is running, click the **Lap** button to record lap times. These times will appear in a list below the stopwatch display.
4. **Reset the Stopwatch**: Click on the **Reset** button to reset the timer and clear the lap times.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the stopwatch, including buttons and display.
- **CSS**: The styling for the stopwatch layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: The logic to handle start/stop functionality, lap times, and timer display updates.
